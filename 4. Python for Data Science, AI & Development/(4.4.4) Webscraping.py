from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # this module helps in web scrapping.
import requests  # this module helps us to download a web page

# We can store it as a string in the variable HTML:
html="<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Page Title</title></head><body><h3><b id='boldest'>Lebron James</b></h3><p> Salary: $ 92,000,000 </p><h3> Stephen Curry</h3><p> Salary: $85,000, 000 </p><h3> Kevin Durant </h3><p> Salary: $73,200, 000</p></body></html>"
# To parse a document, pass it into the BeautifulSoup constructor. The BeautifulSoup object represents the document as a nested data structure:
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html5lib')
# html5lib is an external Python library that parses HTML documents following the HTML5 specification.
# We can use the method prettify() to display the HTML in the nested structure:
print(soup.prettify())

### Tags 

# Let's say we want the title of the page and the name of the top paid player. We can use the Tag. 
# The Tag object corresponds to an HTML tag in the original document, for example, the tag title.
tag_object=soup.title
print("tag object:",tag_object)
# we can see the tag type bs4.element.Tag
print("tag object type:",type(tag_object))
# If there is more than one Tag with the same name, the first element with that Tag name is called. This corresponds to the most paid player:
tag_object=soup.h3
tag_object
# Enclosed in the bold attribute b, it helps to use the tree representation. We can navigate down the tree using the child attribute to get the name.

### Children, Parents, and Siblings

# As stated above, the Tag object is a tree of objects. We can access the child of the tag or navigate down the branch as follows:
tag_child=tag_object.b
tag_child
# You can access the parent with the parent.
parent_tag=tag_child.parent
parent_tag
# this is identical to:
tag_object
# tag_object parent is the body element.
tag_object.parent
# tag_object sibling is the paragraph element.
sibling_1=tag_object.next_sibling
sibling_1
# sibling_2 is the header element, which is also a sibling of both sibling_1 and tag_object
sibling_2=sibling_1.next_sibling
sibling_2

##### Exercise: next_sibling

# Use the object sibling_2 and the method next_sibling to find the salary of Stephen Curry:
sibling_2.next_sibling

#####

### HTML Attributes

# If the tag has attributes, the tag id="boldest" has an attribute id whose value is boldest. 
# You can access a tag's attributes by treating the tag like a dictionary:
tag_child['id']
# You can access that dictionary directly as attrs:
tag_child.attrs
# We can also obtain the content of the attribute of the tag using the Python get() method.
tag_child.get('id')

### Navigable String

# A string corresponds to a bit of text or content within a tag. Beautiful Soup uses the NavigableString class to contain this text. 
# In our HTML we can obtain the name of the first player by extracting the string of the Tag object tag_child as follows:
tag_string=tag_child.string
tag_string
# we can verify the type is Navigable String
type(tag_string)
# To obtain Stephen Curry's string:
next_h3 = tag_object.find_next('h3')
stephen=next_h3.string
stephen
# A NavigableString is similar to a Python string or Unicode string. 
# To be more precise, the main difference is that it also supports some BeautifulSoup features. We can convert it to string object in Python:
unicode_string = str(tag_string)
unicode_string

### Filter

# Filters allow you to find complex patterns, the simplest filter is a string. 
# In this section we will pass a string to a different filter method and Beautiful Soup will perform a match against that exact string.
# We can store it as a string in the variable table:
table="<table><tr><td id='flight'>Flight No</td><td>Launch site</td> <td>Payload mass</td></tr><tr> <td>1</td><td><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida'>Florida<a></td><td>300 kg</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas'>Texas</a></td><td>94 kg</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida'>Florida<a> </td><td>80 kg</td></tr></table>"
table_bs = BeautifulSoup(table, 'html5lib')
table_bs

### find All
# The find_all() method looks through a tag's descendants and retrieves all descendants that match your filters.
# The Method signature for find_all(name, attrs, recursive, string, limit, **kwargs)

### Name
# When we set the name parameter to a tag name, the method will extract all the tags with that name and its children.
table_rows=table_bs.find_all('tr')
table_rows
# The result is a Python iterable just like a list, each element is a tag object:
first_row=table_rows[0]
first_row
# The type is tag
print(type(first_row))
# we can obtain the child
first_row.td
# If we iterate through the list, each element corresponds to a row in the table:
for i,row in enumerate(table_rows):
    print("row",i,"is",row)
# As row is a cell object, we can apply the method find_all to it and extract table cells in the object cells using the tag td, this is all the children with 
# the name td. 
# The result is a list, each element corresponds to a cell and is a Tag object, we can iterate through this list as well. 
# We can extract the content using the string attribute.
for i,row in enumerate(table_rows):
    print("row",i)
    cells=row.find_all('td')
    for j,cell in enumerate(cells):
        print('column',j,"cell",cell)
# If we use a list we can match against any item in that list.
list_input=table_bs .find_all(name=["tr", "td"])
list_input

### Attributes

# If the argument is not recognized it will be turned into a filter on the tag's attributes. 
# For example with the id argument, Beautiful Soup will filter against each tag's id attribute. 
# For example, the first td elements have a value of id of flight, therefore we can filter based on that id value.
table_bs.find_all(id="flight")
# We can find all the elements that have links to the Florida Wikipedia page:
list_input=table_bs.find_all(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida")
list_input
# If we set the href attribute to True, regardless of what the value is, the code finds all tags with href value:
table_bs.find_all(href=True)

##### Exercise: find_all

# Using the logic above, find all the elements without href value
table_bs.find_all(href=False)
# Using the soup object soup, find the element with the id attribute content set to "boldest".
soup.find_all(id='boldest')

#####

### String

# With string you can search for strings instead of tags, where we find all the elments with Florida:
table_bs.find_all(string="Florida")

### find

# The find_all() method scans the entire document looking for results. 
# Itâ€™s useful if you are looking for one element, as you can use the find() method to find the first element in the document.
# We store the HTML as a Python string and assign two_tables:
two_tables="<h3>Rocket Launch </h3><p><table class='rocket'><tr><td>Flight No</td><td>Launch site</td> <td>Payload mass</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Florida</td><td>300 kg</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Texas</td><td>94 kg</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Florida </td><td>80 kg</td></tr></table></p><p><h3>Pizza Party  </h3><table class='pizza'><tr><td>Pizza Place</td><td>Orders</td> <td>Slices </td></tr><tr><td>Domino's Pizza</td><td>10</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Little Caesars</td><td>12</td><td >144 </td></tr><tr><td>Papa John's </td><td>15 </td><td>165</td></tr>"
# We create a BeautifulSoup object two_tables_bs
two_tables_bs=BeautifulSoup(two_tables, 'html.parser')
# html.parser is a built-in parser included with Python's standard library. Faster and lighter than html5lib but 'less effective'.
# We can find the first table using the tag name table
two_tables_bs.find("table")
# We can filter on the class attribute to find the second table, but because class is a keyword in Python, we add an underscore to differentiate them.
two_tables_bs.find("table",class_='pizza')

### Downloading And Scraping The Contents Of A Web Page

# We Download the contents of the web page:
url = "http://www.ibm.com"
# We use get to download the contents of the webpage in text format and store in a variable called data:
data  = requests.get(url).text
data
# We create a BeautifulSoup object using the BeautifulSoup constructor
soup = BeautifulSoup(data,"html5lib")  # create a soup object using the variable 'data'
soup
# Scrape all links
for link in soup.find_all('a',href=True):  # in html anchor/link is represented by the tag <a>
    print(link.get('href'))

## Scrape all images Tags

for link in soup.find_all('img'):# in html image is represented by the tag <img>
    print(link)
    print(link.get('src'))

## Scrape data from HTML tables

#The below url contains an html table with data about colors and color codes.
url = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/datasets/HTMLColorCodes.html"

# Before proceeding to scrape a web site, you need to examine the contents and the way data is organized on the website. 
# Open the above url in your browser and check how many rows and columns there are in the color table.

# get the contents of the webpage in text format and store in a variable called data
data  = requests.get(url).text
soup = BeautifulSoup(data,"html5lib")
#find a html table in the web page
table = soup.find('table') # in html table is represented by the tag <table>
table
#Get all rows from the table
for row in table.find_all('tr'): # in html table row is represented by the tag <tr>
    # Get all columns in each row.
    cols = row.find_all('td') # in html a column is represented by the tag <td>
    color_name = cols[2].string # store the value in column 3 as color_name
    color_code = cols[3].text # store the value in column 4 as color_code
    print("{}--->{}".format(color_name,color_code))
